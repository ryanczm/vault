The field of time series analysis originated in the late 1960s/70s. Professor Hyndman places the “earliest non-trivial study of time series forecast accuracy” as occurring in a 1969 doctoral dissertation at the University of Nottingham, just a year before the publication of the Box-Jenkins method.

* George Box was considered the pioneer of the field. Thanks George!
