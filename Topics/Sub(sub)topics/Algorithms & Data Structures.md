# Useful Computational Patterns

Data structures & algorithms capture specific computational pattern expressed in code.  They let the processor manipulate memory (data) in a specific pattern to achieve an objective. 

* People realized when building software they required to achieve the same objectives repeatedly, which required usage of specific patterns repeatedly. These patterns got formalized as DS&A.
* The goal is the execute the pattern in the least number of instructions so your CPU can do other things.
* DS&As are an abstraction layer above source code.

# Examples

* Sorting is used whenever you have any sort functionality (tables, databases, etc).
* Trees & hash tables are used extensively in databases.
* Trees are used in compiler syntax analysis (AST).
* Stacks are used in program translation (e.g functions).
* FFTs are used in signal processing.
* Graph algorithms are used in Google Maps (shortest paths) and computer networking (IP routing).
* Tries are used in string manipulation (spell-check).
