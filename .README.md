This repository contains my adapted Obsidian implementation of `robertmartin8`'s amazing [Molecular Notes](https://reasonabledeviations.com/2022/04/18/molecular-notes-part-1/) philosophy. I can't thank him enough for this, I've adapted his PKM systems and benefited hugely, which he shared kindly online. It is slightly different in several areas: more hierarchical branching & nesting of folders (as composed to completely flat), no automation scripts (everything manual), less focus on sources (Notion & Whimsical provide my source structure).

# Philosophy

* **Concept-centric vs Source-centric** - Previously I had taken notes in Notion, structured by source. For example, for a particular topic (Math) & subtopic (Linear Algebra), there would be 10 sources (textbooks) and notes for each of them. This was a problem because of duplication, which was highlighted in Molecular Notes. Hence, I decided to make it content-centric in Obsidian. This meant sources are hidden nodes in my Obsidian graph. One can imagine a canonical representation of concepts for a topic. Then each textbook or source is merely the authors own sample of the canonical representation with unique perspective. Hence, I organize my sources in Notion & Whimsical (tabular format), and make Obsidian as source-agnostic as possible. There is one caveat: for small sources (e.g articles, YouTube videos, papers, word of mouth etc), I keep them in Obsidian. 

* **Flat vs Hierarchical** - The original Molecular Notes implementation was completely flat. This meant every atom connects to a topic. However, I decided to add some hierarchy: topic → subtopic → subsubtopic → keyatoms → atoms. I feel like the effectiveness of this depends on the nature of the topic itself. Some fields of study do not lend themselves to having hierarchical structures, others do. For example, in computer architecture, the CPU itself could be a keyatom, and branching out to it would be the constituent atoms: the control unit, ALU, MMU, cache, registers, clock, microarchitecture etc.

* **Latent Connections** - Molecular Notes emphasizes latent connections, which are used to form molecules. These are your own insights to see how atoms link together. Again, I wonder if some fields are more suited to latent connections (e.g physics, maths) vs those that are not (computer science), and if there is a law or property of these fields that makes them so.

**Atomic Tags** - I do not include sources as an atom because of the concept-centric philosophy I highlighted above. I am trialing keyatoms as an additional layer of hierarchy - where keyatoms are subsubsubtopics. However, the effectiveness depends on the nature of the topic itself. It would be nice to have some law or hypothesis or property that can explain when a topic suits hierarchy vs flatness.

**Levels of Understanding** - I color each atom (node) in the graph via the level of understanding in increasing shades of red to pink. This lets me see in graph view where my level of understanding is for each atom. There is no rigorous way to assess the level of understanding. 

As a baseline, exploratory & basic are when one learns it, moderate comes when one practices the concept sufficiently, and good comes when one has practiced the concept for a long while.

I also realized the importance of top-down learning. This idea means one will, upon learning a new field, try to map out the structure or concept map as a foundation. This often equates to reading Wikipedia and making my graph. This is to gain high-level intuition before going deeper. Interestingly, one draws parallels between Wikipedia and Molecular Notes, they are very similar because Wikipedia technically is a linked graph too! An interesting similarity.
