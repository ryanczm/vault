# Proof Square Root of 2 Is Irrational Qn

Q: As above, can you prove the square root of 2 is irrational?
A: Use contradiction. So assume it is rational (irreducible) first: $p^2/q^2=2$ then $2q^2=p^2$. This implies $p$ and $p^2$ is even and $p=2n$, so $2q^2=(2n)^2=4n^2$ and $q^2=2n^2$ and so $q$ and $q^2$ is even. Now we show both $p$ and $q$ are even. But if this is true, then it is not rational because it can be divided by 2. Infinite descent.
