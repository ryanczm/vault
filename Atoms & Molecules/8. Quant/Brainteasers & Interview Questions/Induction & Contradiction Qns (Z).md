# Coin Split Problem (I)

Q: You have 1000 coins. You split them into $x,y$ and multiply to get $xy$. You split each $x \rightarrow x_1, x_2$ and $y \rightarrow y_1, y_2$ and multiply so the sum is $xy+x_1x_2+y_1y_2$. You do this until you have piles of 1 coin each. What is the sum and prove it is the same no matter how you divide the piles.
A: Let $f(n)$ be the sum. $f(n)=1+2+ \cdots + (n-1)=n(n-1)/2$. The trick is to notice $f(2)=1, f(3)=3, f(4)=6, f(5)=10=1+2+3+4$. So $f(1000)=1000\cdot999/2$.

# Chocolate Bar Breaking Problem (I)

Q: A chocolate bar has 6 rows and 8 columns (48 small 1x1 squares). What is the total number of breaks needed to break the bar into 48 small squares?
A: With each break, the number of pieces increases by 1 because it breaks one piece into 2. Thus, for $mn$ pieces, we need $mn-1$ breaks.

# Race Track Problem (I)

Q: You are on a 1 way circular race track. There are $N$ gas cans randomly placed on different locations of the track and the sum of gas in the cans is enough for just one circle. Can you always find a starting position on the track so you can complete one circle?
A: Yes. But this is assuming you know the exact amount of gas in each can (e.g you can see the labels) from a bird's eye view.
