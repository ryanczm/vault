# Chance of Child Being Girl Given Girl (4.43)

Q: I have two children, at least one is a girl. What's the probability I have two girls?
A: Trick question. Wordplay is at least one is a girl. The pickpocket answer is 1/2. But realize girl could be first or second child. GG, GB, BG, BB. Exclude BB so 1/3. BG is not GB because order of the child matters.
