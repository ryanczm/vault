# Stock Standard Deviation Qn (3.2)

Q: If s.d of continuously compounded annual stock returns is 10%, what is the s.d of continuously compounded 4 year stock returns?
A: This is a vol qn. Remember, to scale, we have to use square root, so 10% x 2 = 20%.

# Chaos Theory Qn (3.5)

Q: What is Chaos Theory and how is it connected to finance?
A: Ed Lorenz (not Henrik Lonrentz) discovered computer simulation of weather are very sensitive to initial conditions. Therefore it is 'sensitive to initial conditions'. It is deterministic, not stochastic but somehow random.

# CAPM Qn (3.7)

Q: If empirical SML is above or below theoretical CAPM SML (SML is the beta/return relationship), what is the explanation?
A: If we trust CAPM, then it means overvalue/undervalued. However, CAPM is limited because it only takes into account a single risk factor - aka the beta factor to price a stock.

# Given Ex, Std and Corr, Do Allocation (3.19)

Q: Two stocks have the same expected return. One has s.d 20% and other 30%. Their correlation is 50%. How do I allocate money between the two to minimize my risk?
A: The answer asks us to find the weights of the two-stock m.v.p. We can do this analytically by taking the derivative of portfolio variance w.r.t weights, setting it to 0, checking minimum and solving for weights.

We first find an expression $\sigma^2= f(\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \rho)$. Then, we find $\frac{\partial \sigma^2}{\partial \omega}=0$

Q: Note for certain values of $\rho$ e.g -1, then the solution is special.
