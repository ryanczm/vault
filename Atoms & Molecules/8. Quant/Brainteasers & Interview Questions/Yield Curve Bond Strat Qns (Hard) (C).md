# Overview

These questions involve asking some belief about of a change in rates (in terms of yield curve) and how you would create a bond strategy to profit. 

# Current Yield Curve Qn (TM capital)

Q: What is the current US yield curve?
A: [Gurufocus - Current US YC](https://www.gurufocus.com/yield_curve.php). Currently inverted (Dec 2022), 106bps spread (10Y-1Y). When we plot the spread, a negative spread historically is a leading indicator of economic recession.

# Yield Curve Steepen & Bond Strategy Qn (3.10)

Q: You think yield curve will steepen very soon (longer term securities yield increase and shorter term securities decreases). What strategy should you pursue in bond market to profit from this belief? Give a short run strategy (e.g profit off this yield curve change ASAP).
A: The tricks is to connect this to the yield-price inverse relationship. You believe that short term debt is going to be more expensive and long term debt is going to be cheaper. So you long short-term debt and short long-term debt. However, you should **match duration** and price of positions (low coupon short term debt and high-coupon short term debt) for the horizon (until the YC changes and you close out).

# Yield Curve Flatten Zeroes Strategy Qn (3.15)

Q: You construct a yield curve for coupon bearing securities. A 5Y corporate zero has default risk premium 1% over corresponding T-bond yield. You think YC will flatten: short term yields rise, long term rates fall, medium remains same. How can you profit using your 5Y zeroes?
A: You should short your 5Y corporate bond and buy long term securities. The trick is to ensure your duration is zero for the horizon (Right until after the YC changes, then you close out)
