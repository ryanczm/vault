These involve some **precise visualization technique** where you must simulate visually and precisely the problem setup.

# Inscribed Circle Problem (1.7)

Q: Suppose I inscribe a circle within a square so that the circle just touches the four sides of the square. Suppose there is exactly enough room to fit a rectangle of dimensions 5 Ã— 10 into one corner of the square so that the rectangle just touches the circle. What is the side length of the square?
A: Draw the diagram, use Pythagoreas' theorem.

# Bug Walk in Cubic Room Problem (1.8)

Q: Too easy.

# Clock Angle Between Hands Problem (1.12)

Q: How many degrees between angle of hour and minute hands of a clock at 3.15?
A: 360/12/4 = 7.5. Use visualization.

# Ants on Ruler Problem (1.23)

Q: 10000 ants on a 100cm ruler. Each ant either goes up or down ruler at 1cm/s. If collide, they turn around and go at same pace. Ants cannot stop. How long till all ants walk off ruler?
A: 100 seconds. Apparently, a collision is equivalent to two ants swapping routes, they are fungible, so max is 100s. Its equivalent to ants passing through each other.

# Rock and Pool Problem (1.39)

Q: Small boat with point mass heavy rock inside is floating on pool. If rock is tossed into pool, what happens to water level?
A: The boat will displace less, water level will drop.

# Earth and North South East West Problem (1.61)

Q: How many places are there on the Earth where you can walk one mile south, one mile east, one mile north, and end up exactly where you started?
A: Worldquant asked this. Answer is infinity places. LOL

# Russian Roulette Problem (4.28)

Q: You are tied to chair. Revolver pointed at you. Gangster loads two rounds, side-by-side in chamber. Pulls trigger. Nothing happens. Gangster asks you, should I pull the trigger again or spin then pull? If you survive, I'll set you free. What do you do?
A: Trick qn. Visualize barrel. There are 4 empty slots where the pin could have struck on the last pull. Now, if you don't spin, only 1/4 chance of dying (the pin right beside the rounds in direction of rotation). If you spin, it's 1/3 chance (both rounds in play). So don't spin it. Just shoot.
