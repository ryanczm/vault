There are two types of alpha models - theory vs data driven.

In **theory models**, one **starts with a hypothesis**, then formulates a strategy by pulling in the required data, implementing the strategy and evaluating it. 

In **data driven models**, one **starts with data**, then does some kind of data analysis/machine learning to generate ideas or hypotheses, then tests out the strategy and evaluates it.
