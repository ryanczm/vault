----
Risk models limit **position size** - how much money to use, either in **absolute terms** or by **leverage** and **position choice**.
## Limiting by Constraint or Penalty

A risk model could dictate the trader cannot take a position size in any trade larger than some arbitrary (e.g 5%) of the portfolio.
