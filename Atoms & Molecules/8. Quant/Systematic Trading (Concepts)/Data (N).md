# Types of Data

There are four kinds of data, price (market) data, fundamental data, macroeconomic data and alternative data. **Data** in general are kept in **databases**.

## Price Data

**Price (market) data** refers to not just prices of instruments, but other information received or derived from exchanges or transactions. These are all the information generated directly from the exchange.

* E.g **tick data** (a tick is the minimum upward or downward movement in the price of a security). Tick data is the the data of the **stream of transactions that have occurred on the exchange** (the tick data is not the order book!).
* An OHLC (open, high, low, close) chart shows individual OHLC bars per unit time (e.g day). Each bar has 4 points, the open, high, low, close. We can use OHLC to eyeball intraday volatility (by looking at the open and close)

## Fundamental Data

Narang defines fundamental data as any kind of data that is not price data that is related to the instrument itself. E.g financial health, financial performance, financial worth, and sentiment.

## Macroeconomic Data

Macroeconomic data refers to general data about the economy that is not directly related to instrument prices.

## Alternative Data

From K&K, alternative data comes from individuals, business processes, sensors, social media, transaction data (?), satellites, news and reviews, corporate data, geolocation, web searching, governments, etc.
