# Definition

Economic activity indicators measure the **production** & **consumption** of goods and services.

# GDP (Quarterly)

Gross domestic product is published in **nominal** and **inflation-adjusted real dollars** quarterly in **absolute amounts** and **growth rates** (GDP for that quarter) by the economic statistics department of any government. Similar to corporate data, analysts have GDP estimates, beating or underperforming estimates can have an impact. 

Basically, the higher the growth, the more people are spending and consuming, meaning they have more money.
