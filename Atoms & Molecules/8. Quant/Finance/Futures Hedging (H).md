# Overview

Futures market participants either seek to **take profit** by trading futures or **hedge risk**. When we say hedge risk, this means to **secure/lock in** a profit/price at an **expected value**, and **reduce any deviation** (upwards or downwards). Why? So they can make plans in advance based on this locked in value.

# Short Hedge

A **short hedge** is used by a hedger that owns an asset and has contracted to sell it sometime in the future.

Example - An oil producer wishes to sell on Aug 15 (today is May 15). After today (spot), the producer will gain/lose $10k for each 1c increase/decrease in oil price. So, the producer will short (sell) some oil futures to lock in the price.

# Long Hedge

A long hedge is used by a hedger that wants to buy an asset in the future and locks in the price.

# Basis Risk

Basis risk refers to imperfect hedging.
