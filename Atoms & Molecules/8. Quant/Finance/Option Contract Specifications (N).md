# Type, Underlying, Expiration Date, Strike Price

**Type** - A put option is an option to sell. A call option is an option to buy.
**Underlying** - The **underlying** is the security or commodity to be bought or sold under the terms of the option contract. The **quantity** is set by an exchange - e.g 1 option to buy/sell 100 shares of a stock.
**Expiration Date** - The expiration date is when the owner must make the final decision to buy or sell to the counterparty the underlying at strike. 
**Strike Price** - The exercise price is usually at intervals in a range of the underlying, what price the buy/seller will pay/get when exercising

# Exercise and Assignment, Long vs Short

**Long and Short** - These refer to the buyer and seller of the option (**not the underlying**).
**Buyer and Seller** - These refer to who is actually buying and selling the underlying.
**Exercise and Assignment** - The buyer (long) can **exercise** the option, to which the seller (short) is **assigned**.
**Example -** If you are long and exercise a call, you can buy from the short who is assigned to sell.
**Style** - European-style can only be exercised at expiration, whereas American style can be exercised before.

# Settlement Methods

After exercise, the transaction occurs - called settling.

**Settlement into Underlying (Stock)** - the seller will receive cash, the buyer receives the stock.
**Settlement into Futures Position (Futures)** - The buyer and seller take up long (or short) positions in a futures contract. This straight away requires setup of margin accounts with the futures exchange and daily (futures) settlement occurs (variation).
**Settlement into Cash** - If an option cash settles, then the difference between the exercise price and the market price is transacted. E.g if you exercise 3 March 250 calls, and the current index is 300, you get credited 50 x 500 x 3 = 75000. No more positions!
