# Capital Allocation Line

The capital allocation line is expressed as the tangency line to the parabola of the highest Sharpe ratio portfolio on the efficient frontier (upper half of the bullet).

# Efficient Frontier

The efficient frontier is the locus of points $\{(\sigma_p,\mu_p)\}$ corresponding to optimal portfolios (highest reward for a given level of risk). If the portfolio contains only risky assets, there is a quadratic relationship between $\sigma_p$ and $\mu_p$ and is diagrammed with the Markowitz bullet on a risk-return spectrum. The e.f is the upper half of the m.b.

* The max Sharpe ratio portfolio & minimum variance portfolio are points on this curve.
* Lagrange multipliers lets us express the weights as a matrix multiplication problem which can be solved.

# Minimum Variance Portfolio

# Tangency Portfolio

The tangency portfolio is the portfolio that maximizes Sharpe ratio (theoretically). It consists of holding $n$ risky assets and a risk-free asset (T-bill). The expression for it allocates weights amongst risky assets, but **does not** tell you how to allocate total capital between risky assets and the riskless asset.
