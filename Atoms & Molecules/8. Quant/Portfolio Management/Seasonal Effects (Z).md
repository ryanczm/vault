# Overview

**Market phenomena** or **seasonal effects** refer to cyclical effects that happen to the market after some event. These happen periodically, meaning they keep happening over and over again. These are all caused by human (investor) behavior.

These are **market seasonality** (effects that occur on the entire market as a whole, e.g S&P) and **cross-sectional seasonality** (different cross-sectional subsets of the market, like industry and market cap).
