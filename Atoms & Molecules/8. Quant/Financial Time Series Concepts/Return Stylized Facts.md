Returns exhibit several stylized characteristics. These are the emergent or latent properties of aggregate investor behavior in financial markets that seem to be constant over the long term.

## Non-Stationarity

Returns are non-stationary - past returns do not always reflect future returns. Going up does not always mean going up. This is because companies don't always do well!

## No Autocorrelation

Autocorrelation is lagged correlation. There is no reason why there should be any lagged correlation consistently, any autocorrelation is due to pure luck and statistically significant.

## Heavy Tails

Returns plotted on a histogram have heavy tails (extreme returns) and are non-Gaussian. This is due to the fact that a Gaussian p.d.f does not encapsulate human behavior of buying and selling financial instruments, there isn't much else to explain it.

## Volatility Clustering

Volatility tends to be clustered (high volatility events) in periods of time. Again, this is because some systematic risk event caused investors to panic.

## Aggregate Gaussiannity at Lower Return Frequencies

For lower frequencies, returns become more Gaussian. This is probably due to the fact extreme events don't occur at a lower frequency.
