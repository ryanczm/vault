# Definition

The capital asset pricing model is a pricing method for valuing a stock. It says the expected return of a stock is the risk-free rate plus the market premium multiplied by the Beta of the stock.  $$E(R_i)=R_f+\beta(E(R_m)-R_f)$$
# Security Market Line

The security market line is the graphical representation of the [[CAPM]]. It displays the expected return of a individual security as a function of it's exposure to systematic risk (Beta). 

# Relation to Factor Analysis

Using factor analysis formalism, notice how the CAPM is a single factor model s.t the loading is $\beta$ of the single factor of **market returns** with $k=1$ and $j=1$.

The CAPM model was introduced by Treynor, Sharpe and Lintner in the 1960s building upon the work of Markowitz on modern portfolio theory.
