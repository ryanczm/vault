# Definition

A **risk premia factor** is a **fancy term** for a risk factor like Value, Carry etc. A premia is multiple premiums. A premium is reward given for risk. 

# Risk Premia Factors are Constructed from Some Investment Strategy

Remember, since factors are derived from **some investment strategy** (e.g a carry or long-short of value), they can be constructed, held and **harvested for the returns** (premium.)

# Factors are Time Series Features

From a data science perspective, all factors are simply time series features. How they are constructed is the creative part.

# Examples of Equity Factors

It is quite amazing and ridiculous how much juice can be squeezed out of simple market (price) data to create 100+ features.
