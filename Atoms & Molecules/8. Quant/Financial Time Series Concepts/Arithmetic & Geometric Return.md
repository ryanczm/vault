## Arithmetic Return

Given a return series over $n$ holding periods, the arithmetic return is the mean of the return series, taken by adding each holding period return and taking the average. $$A=\frac{\sum r_i}{n}$$
## Geometric Return

Given a return series over $n$ holding periods, the geometric return is the product of the return series (+1) to its $n^{th}$ root. The 1 is added to each term to avoid negative percentages, then subtracted out.$$G=[\prod( 1+R_i)]^{\frac{1}{n}}-1$$

## AM-GM Inequality

The AM-GM inequality states the arithmetic mean of a list of positive real numbers is always greater or equal to the geometric mean of the same list. This bounds the geometric mean by the arithmetic mean. Consider the simplest non-trivial case: $$\frac{x+y}{2}\geq \sqrt{xy}$$
