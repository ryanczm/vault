# Volume

**Volume** refers to the amount of instrument traded (bought or sold) in a fixed time interval (e.g average volume per hour, or volume over a month). However, cheap instruments tend to have higher volume, so to standardize for dollar amount, we can use **turnover**.

The turnover is the volume multiplied by price $T=V*P$, which **adjusts volume for price**.

# Average Daily Volume

The ADV is the average dollar volume per day for an asset. A trade size can be measured as the size of the trade divided by the ADV. A larger trade size will move the price more.
