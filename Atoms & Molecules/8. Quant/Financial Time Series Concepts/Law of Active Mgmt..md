# Definition

The **law of active management** states that the information ratio is the information coefficient scaled by the square root of breadth. Information ratio is **performance**.

Breadth is the number of independent bets. A fundamental discretionary investor might have a higher IC, but less breadth. Quants can scale breadth easily by **combining many alpha factors** or increasing the breadth of the **cross-section of instruments held**.

Popularized by Grinold and Kahn's *Active Portfolio Managment (1994)*.

# Real World Restrictions

However, increasing breadth and volume to maximize IR is subject to real world constraints of **liquidity** and **transaction costs**. 

A **high bid-ask spread** can cause losses the more you trade.
