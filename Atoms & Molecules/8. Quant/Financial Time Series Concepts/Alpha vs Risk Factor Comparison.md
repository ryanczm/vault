# Types of Factors

Factors are divided into alpha factors and risk factors as a spectrum. These factors can also be classified as **reversal or momentum factors**.

## Alpha Factors

Alpha factors predict the mean of return distribution. An example is the **market cap factor** (SMB).

## Risk Factors

Risk factors predict the variance of return distribution. An example is the **market return** - if a portfolio has high exposure to market return relative to other factors, then this results in high risk.

# Factor Heuristics (Comparing Risk vs Alpha Factors)

**Impact of Price Movement -** Risk factors tend to contribute more to price movement compared to alpha factors. 

**Variance of Factor Values** - Risk factors tend to have higher variance or potential fluctuation as compared to alpha factors (e.g the SMB factor might have less volatility than the market return factor).

**Public Awareness** - In general, risk factors are more well known than alpha factors. E.g the 1981 publication of the size factor resulted in alpha decay for that factor.

# Alpha Decay and Transition from Alpha to Risk

Alpha factors decay into risk factors since more people get aware of it over time and use it. Similar to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy always increases.
