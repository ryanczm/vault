# Definition

In the **cross-sectional approach**, **factor exposures** are first identified from some characteristic (e.g book-to-market, or country exposure) for multiple stocks, then a **cross-sectional regression** is done at each point in time to estimate the **factor returns** as the slope of the regression.

In industry, cross-sectional models are more commonly used and are provided by companies like Barra, Axioma, etc.
