**Overnight returns (closed-open returns)** refers to the returns calculated from the **close price of the day before** and the **open price at the day after**. Often, there is a discontinuous jump between the close price and open price of the next day. For example, note how the price of AAPL jumped from close of 25th October to open of 26th October - from 4pm the previous day to 9am the next day. ![[overnight_return.png | 300]]
# Why do Prices Jump from Previous Day Close to Next Day Open? 

Prices jump in the overnight because of **after-hours trading** and **market-on-open (MOO) orders**. In after-hours trading, brokers only accept limit orders (must set price) which is fulfilled via an ECN. The price changes are not shown in the after hours, leading to a spike.

**MOO orders** are orders to be **executed at the day's opening price**. Investors can place MOO orders based on last night's news, leading to a spike.
