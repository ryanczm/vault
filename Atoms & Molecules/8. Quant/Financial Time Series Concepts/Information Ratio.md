**Information ratio** is an overloaded term. In a standalone context, it refers to the Sharpe ratio of excess returns over a risky benchmark: $$IR = \frac{E[R_p-R_b]}{\sqrt{Var[R_p-R_b]}}$$
While Sharpe ratio benchmarks return-reward over a risk free rate, IR benchmarks against a risky market index like the S&P. We can use this to evaluate how well a strategy performed in terms of risk-adjusted return relative to the risky benchmark.
