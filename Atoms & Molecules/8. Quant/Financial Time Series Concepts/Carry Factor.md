# Definition

The carry factor is broadly defined as the **expected return on an asset by holding its price fixed**. For equities, the carry factor is defined as dividend yield (**going long stocks with high dividend yield and shorting stocks with low dividend yield)**.

# Carry for Bonds

It is defined as the **term structure of rates**.

# Carry for Commodities

It is defined by the **roll return**.

# Carry for Currencies

Carry was originally defined for currencies. An example is defined [here](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/foreign-exchange/fx-carry-trade/). A trader, noticing a relative difference in interest rate between two currencies, will short (borrow) the low interest rate currency, exchange it into the high interest rate currency, then invest in a security that pays the interest rate (e.g some bond). After maturity, the trader reverses the exchange then closes the short.

But how is this defined as a factor for a currency?
