Liquidity refers to the relative ease or time taken to buy or sell an asset without causing a drastic change in the asset price. Liquidity involves a trade-off between the **price of which an asset can be sold** and how **quickly it can be sold**.

In illiquid market, one must **discount an asset significantly** to decrease the selling time to which it can be sold quickly, similar to the space-time tradeoff in computer science.
