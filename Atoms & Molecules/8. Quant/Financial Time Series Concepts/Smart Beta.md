**Smart beta investment portfolios** are **long-only rules-based investment strategies** that aim to **outperform** a **market-capitalization weighted benchmark**.

Given some market index and its weights by market cap, a smart beta fund aims to modify these weights slightly to gain exposure or beta to one or more types of factors like momentum, earnings quality, low volatility, dividends, etc. They are **balanced relatively infrequently** and are **passively managed**.
