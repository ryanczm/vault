# Overview

This chapter deals with creating basic alpha factors. The examples are Fama french factor betas, and technical indicators with `talib`. After that, Jansen uses wavelets and Kalman filters to smooth series (gimmicky) and shows how to use Alphalens to evaluate a simple mean reversion factor. The content of this chapter has been covered in AI4T.
