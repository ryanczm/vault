This chapter deals with using PCA and hierarchical clustering. PCA is used for Eigenportfolios (some way of doing portfolio optimization) and hierarchical clustering is used for hierarchical risk parity.

These seem to be done at the portfolio optimization stage when integrating risk information with alpha signals (?).
