# Strategy Overview

In this exercise, we use cosine similarity of 10k's to 6 themes: `positive, negative, uncertainty, litigious, constraining, interesting` as factors. For a stock, there are 6 factors, each representing how similar the 10k for that year is to that theme. 

Return frequency is yearly. This is used and factors are evaluated. Because the data is from 1995-2017, Sharpe is generally high. 

Factor rank autocorrelation varies hugely, because the portfolio is rebalanced on a yearly basis.
