# Overview

This is a technical document highlighting how alternative data is used in quant investing by Krishnamachari and Kolanovic in 2017 at JPM. 

There seem to be a **huge amount of firms being data vendors** to investment firms and banks - especially quantitative investors. Means there is huge profit in it.

# ML Algorithms

It is clear Rajesh and Kolanovic have a fundamental understanding of the ML algorithms used - at least on a mathematical level - they are able to derive succintly the equations for them (e.g Kalman). By definition, they should.

Thus, I need to achieve a similar level of understanding.
