The law of total expectation is essentially the expectation operator applied to the law of total probability. It states $$E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^nE(X|A_i) \cdot P(A_i)=E[E[X|Y]]$$In other words, the expectation is the sum of conditional expectations multiplied by the probability of that event happening. We have been unconsciously applying this law as *recursion* under Crack.
