# Variance as Expected Squared Distance from Expectation

Variance, as per Blitzstein, is the expected squared distance from the expectation. Thus, there are two expectation operators: $Var(X)=E[X-E(X)]^2=E[X-\mu]^2$.

# Variance as Expected Value of Squared R.V minus Squared Expectation

Now expanding this square gives us the term $E(X^2)$ or expectation of the squared variable $Var(X)=E(X^2)-(EX)^2$. Thus we can find $E(X^2)=(E(X))^2+Var(X)$. For the normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$, the expectation of the squared variable is $E(X^2)=\mu^2 + \sigma^2$.
