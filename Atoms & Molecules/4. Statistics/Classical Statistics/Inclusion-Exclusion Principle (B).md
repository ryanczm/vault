# Overview

The inclusion exclusion principle is a principle for finding the probability of a union of events when events are not necessarily disjoint. 

# Two Event Case 

$$P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$
# Three Event Case

$$P(A \cup B \cup C)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C) - P(A \cup B) - P(A \cup C) - P(B \cup C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)$$
This can be visualized by a Venn diagram. We subtract the dual intersects, then add the combined intersect.
