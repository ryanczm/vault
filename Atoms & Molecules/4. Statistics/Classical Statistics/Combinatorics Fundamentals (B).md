# Binomial Coefficient (N Choose K)

The binomial coefficient is the formula of how many unordered ways to choose $k$ from $n$ (E.g choose 3 people from a group of 25) - the number of combinations that can be generated. The formula is $$\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
So for $\binom{n}{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$

# Permutation

Once we choose our combinations, we can permute each one internally by multiplying by $k!$, which gets rid of it in the denominator.
