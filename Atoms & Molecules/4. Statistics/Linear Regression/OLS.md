Gauss invented least squares as a tool to calculate the orbit of the asteroid Ceres in his 1809 treatise *Theory of the Motion of Heavenly Bodies Moving About the Sun in Conic Sections*. 

* Legendre had published first, in 1805, *New Methods for Determination of the Orbits of Comets*. But Gauss claimed he had discovered it first. 
* Gauss didn't put much importance on it, saying "it was not the greatest of discoveries". Gauss was a gigachad.
* Then Galton, Pearson and Fisher advanced it.
