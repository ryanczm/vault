A strictly (strongly) stationary process (time series) is one that has a unconditional joint probability distribution that does not change when shifted in time: the underlying d.g.p is really constant over time. $$F_X(x_{t_1+\tau}, \cdots,x_{t_n+\tau})=F_X(x_{t_1},\cdots,x_{t_n}) \quad \quad \forall \space \tau \in \mathbb{R}, \space n\in \mathbb{N}$$
If the process has an **analytical d.g.p** like white noise - a Gaussian standard normal, and is i.i.d, then it is strongly stationary - the p.d.f is always the same regardless of which time interval you pick.
