A correlogram is a chart of correlation statistics. In time series analysis, the correlogram is a plot of correlation against lags.

* The x-axis is the number of lags in increasing order.
* The y-axis is the correlation between $x_t, x_{t-\ell}$ for lag order $\ell$ for all the $T-\ell$ values in the time series (the front $\ell$ values do not have lags).
