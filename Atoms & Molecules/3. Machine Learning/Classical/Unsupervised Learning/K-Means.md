K-means is a method of vector quantization (originally from signal processing) that partitions $n$ observations into $k$ clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest distance - which partitions the data space into Voronoi cells

* It seeks to minimize WCSS (Within Cluster Sum of Squared Error).
