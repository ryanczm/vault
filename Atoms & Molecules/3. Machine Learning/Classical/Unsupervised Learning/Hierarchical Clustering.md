# Overview

Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique that builds a hierarchy of cluster (one cluster is a data point in another cluster, recursively). There is **agglomerative** (bottom-up) and **divisive** (top-down) clustering.

# Pairwise Distance Metric

The pairwise distance metric is a computation that produces outputs a distance as a positive number from two data points. There are many ways to do this.

# Linkage

A linkage metric computes a distance as a positive number from two clusters. There are many ways to do this.
