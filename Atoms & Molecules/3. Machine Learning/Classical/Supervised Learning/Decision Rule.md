A decision rule is a boolean function that evaluates if a certain feature out of the feature space, say $x_i \in X$, is above or below a certain threshold, e.g $f(x_i < k)=1$ (the decision criteria). This determines which samples get passed to which of the two child nodes from the parent node. 

* The decision criteria is computed from all the sample data contained in that node.
