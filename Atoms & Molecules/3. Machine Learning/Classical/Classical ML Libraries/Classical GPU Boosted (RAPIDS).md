Classical GPU boosted libraries are primarily created as open source libraries by NVIDIA under the name RAPIDS. These are GPU-enabled libraries that are not concerned with deep learning.

* `cuml`  - Classiscal ML with an `sklearn` like interface that runs on the GPU.
* `cudf` - GPU-enabled dataframes.
