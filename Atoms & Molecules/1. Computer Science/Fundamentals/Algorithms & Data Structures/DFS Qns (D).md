# DFS Overview

Depth-first search operates on a graph by operating on a node, **doing something** (some state change) then recursively being called on the neighbours (accessible from the node). 

# State Change

Visit - Change state of the node in a visited list
Count - Add some count or distance, e.g islands problem
Cycle Detection - Terminate and store cycle (if visits a neighbour already visited).
