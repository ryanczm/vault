# Queue Fundamentals

The queue is used in graph algorithms. A queue is a collection of objects. It differs from stack because we treat (do something) with the earliest added object first, the next earliest added object. In a stack, we will do something with the latest added object.

A queue is used when the earliest added object must be treated first, in other words, the longer the object has been inside, the more important it is to treat it. Conversely, in a stack, the longer the object has been inside, we implicitly assume it is less important to treat it.
