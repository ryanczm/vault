# Overview

Prerequisite to actual interview. Reviews at [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.sg/Interview/Hudson-River-Trading-Algorithm-Developer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE470937.0,20_KO21,40.htm). The interview was the most difficult questions so far. 

None of the questions were in Leetcode. I suspect for top-tier companies (e.g top quants, top FAANG), they set custom questions that are **at least hard** or a **tier above hard** that are not available in LC. This means the search strategy does not work.

Well, it turns out that both questions are on Codechef (**counting squares** and **counting rectangles**). Unfortunately, these require **pro subscription**.

The learning point is that the questions can be found, we just need to look hard enough.

# Check if a Number is a Sum of Two Fibonacci Numbers

[Chegg - Check Sum](https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/fibonacci-sequence-defined-follows-begin-array-l-f-1-1-f-2-1-f-n-f-n-1-f-n-2-text-n-2-end--q101190086) - Chegg solution, but slightly wrong answer. Didn't pass test cases.
[Geeks4Geeks - Find 2 Fib Whose Sum is N](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-two-fibonacci-numbers-whose-sum-can-be-represented-as-n/) - Provides a solution and explanation.

Remarks: Perfect solution available

# Saturating the Hyper-Rectangular Prism: Finding Number of Rectangles Formed by Set of Points on a Grid

[Chegg - Counting Rectangles](https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/hrt-trying-saturate-hyperrectangular-prism-given-list-4-leq-n-leq-1000-points-cartesian-pl-q101190108) - Chegg solution. Python.
[Codechef - Counting Rectangles](https://www.codechef.com/status/RECTCNT) - Problem on codechef. Can see user submissions, but need subscription for official solution.
