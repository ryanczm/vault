# Overview

1. Create Obsidian note for the test page.
2. **Search Phase** - For each question, do a web search. Scan each page, add to collection if relevant with a short description
3. **Browsing Phase -** Browse through each link for each question and solve information.
4. **Solution Phase** - Copy over the solution

Because each source has different questions, it is pointless to search on the individual sources and better to focus on **searching with the correct technique**.

# Search + Collection Phase 

**Problem Search** - Google the problem name 
**Keyword Search** - Google the problem statement. Need to be creative in googling different iterations/possible names.
**Quick Check** - Open up the page and have a quick scan. **Spend less than 20s scanning per page**.
**Add to Collection** - After scanning, add the page to the collection with a quick description.
