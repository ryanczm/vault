# Overview

A codec (encoder-decoder) is some program that: takes in raw video input (from a camera) and produces a smaller, compressed version of the video file and takes in the compressed file and produces a video file for  playback.

# Why Codecs?

Codecs are necessary to shrink video size to reduce storage cost until the point that is not noticeable by our eyes.
