## File Definition & Operations

A file is a sequence of bits that has the following abstract operations of CRUD - **create**, **open**, **read**, **write**, **delete** and **close**. The **file extension** specifies how the computer **interprets the sequence of bits**, and which programs can access the file to implement their **specific version** of CRUD operations. There are two key types of files - binary and text.

* **Text files** are files that use an encoding (e.g ASCII or UTF-8 or Unicode) to represent data e.g **text and numbers**.
* **Binary files** are any files that are not a text file. E.g `.jpeg`, .`mp4`, `.wav` like **images, audio and video** are all binary files. Confusingly, binary files like `.h5` (HDF5) can be used to store text-based data too ...  

## File Formats

A **file format** standardizes how the **elementary atomic data units are represented in memory** and **additional information**, and the **set of tools** to **interact** with the file, which defines the **interface** (specific set of CRUD operations that can be done on the file).


## Files to Storage Systems

After that, these data are then stored in **storage systems** - e.g object storage, block storage, file storage.
